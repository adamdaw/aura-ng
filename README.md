aura-ng
=======
Aura-ng is a Force.com package that provides integration between Lightning Components (Aura) and the Angular.js javascri[t library. This project is very much in a nascent state, but there is enough functionality to provide you with a view into where we plan to take this. Here are some of the current capabilities:

- Automatic once and only once loading and initialization semantics for angular JS
- Container components attributes are automatically surfaced as properties on the $scope.v object
